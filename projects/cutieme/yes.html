		<p class="ay" style="text-align: center;">I think you're cute too and pretty, and I really enjoy spending time with you. There's something about your smile that just brightens my day and makes everything feel a little easier, no matter what I'm dealing with. You have this amazing way of making people feel comfortable and appreciated, and honestly, I can’t stop thinking about how lucky I am to know you. It’s not just how you look, though that’s definitely a part of it—it’s the way you carry yourself, the kindness in your voice, and how genuine you are. I feel like I could talk to you forever and never get tired of it.</p>
